Messaging
=========

Messaging is a library intended to help specify and implement network
protocols.

It is a header-only library, so no compilation is necessary.

If you do want the Makefiles to work, for running the tests or installing the
headers (the latter is untested and unlikely to work first time) you'll need to
ensure that the makeshift submodule is present

$ git submodule update --init
